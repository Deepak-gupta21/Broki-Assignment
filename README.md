Assignment Overview:

Repository: https://github.com/Deepak-gupta21/Broki-Assignment
Deployed Link: https://broki-assignment.netlify.app

Problem Statement: I am pleased to confirm that I have successfully addressed the requirements outlined in the assignment's problem statement. The application encompasses two main pages:

Login Page: Upon clicking the "Login" button, users are seamlessly directed to the home page. To facilitate access, the valid credentials are as follows:
- Email ID: agam@broki.in
- Password: Broki@123456

Home Page: Following a successful login, the home page elegantly showcases a curated list of properties. Presently, these property listings are hard-coded to facilitate visualization.

Code Structure and Design Philosophy: My approach to the code's architecture emphasizes modularity, ensuring a foundation for enhanced maintainability and scalability. Inspired by both the aesthetic and functional elements of websites such as www.broki.in and similar platforms, I've crafted a user-friendly interface that prioritizes intuitive navigation.
